# Parking system with ultrasonic sensor and 7-segment display VHDL

## Description
This project presents a smart parking monitoring system designed to optimise the performance of parking spaces. The ultrasonic sensor is able to detect the presence of a car in front of it, and therefore provide information on the 7-segment display about free spaces in the car park and its overall occupancy. Our project implements two such sensors located at the entrance and exit of the car park.

# Hardware

## Nexys A7-50T

The Nexys A7 board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the latest Artix-7™ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx®. With its large, high-capacity FPGA, generous external memories, and collection of USB, Ethernet, and other ports, the Nexys A7 can host designs ranging from introductory combinational circuits to powerful embedded processors. Several built-in peripherals, including an accelerometer, temperature sensor, MEMs digital microphone, a speaker amplifier, and several I/O devices allow the Nexys A7 to be used for a wide range of designs without needing any other components.

## Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

Simple ultrasonic sensor. The basic principle of operation is to receive a reflected signal from an object, so that we can determine its presence and distance to it.
